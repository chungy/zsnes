Few additional notes about WinCvs :

In order to use WinCvs you need the application WinCvs.exe and
the dll's, plus :

1) tcl81.dll and Cw3215mt.dll are provided in order to activate the
TCL support of WinCVS. This library is optionnal. Don't use it
if you have already TCL installed on your disk (tested with tcl8.0
and tcl8.1a2). Refer to http://www.tclconsortium.org.

2) "cvs.exe" is based upon cvs 1.10 code. It is a little
bit different than the Cyclic one because it has some hacks
usefull for WinCvs (dirty files mainly + some extras fixes).

3) You need to set-up some environment variables in
order to use cvs.exe in a dos command (unused by WinCvs) :

HOME : the location for cvs to find global settings files
(.cvspass, .cvsignore, .cvsrc)...
PATH : needs to point out the WinCvs folder.
CVSROOT : your CVSROOT.

4) If you use it WinCvs in "client" mode (means your cvs
repository is accessed thru TCP/IP) and your server is a cvs-1.9
server, you need patch.exe.

5) All the others exe are used in local mode only.

Note (8/20/98) : If you got some problems with the files patching,
please update your server to cvs-1.10. Later versions of WinCvs
don't support anymore cvs-1.9.

Enjoy !
