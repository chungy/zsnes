      - Fixed Empire Strikes Back crashing bug in the millenium falcon
        sequence (hopefully this will fix some other games too)
      - Removed all self-modifying code in ZSNES.  This will make ZSNES crash
        a lot less on certain systems, especially during mode 7 sequences.
        Thanks Ivar!
      - Implemented S-RTC chip, using the system clock as the actual
        time (The game will make you set the time though, but it will just
        be replaced with the system time in-game).  Thanks to John Weidman and
        Dark Force for the info on this chip!
      - Fixed crashing bug in certain mosaic scenes (eg. FF3 Phantom Forest)
        in the new graphics engine
      - Fixed a nasty crashing/corruption bug in the new graphics engine
        (both 8bit and 16bit)
      - SPC7110 emulation!  This is based on the information reverse
        engineered by the hard working folks at dejap translations,
        Dark Force and John Weidman.
      - Altered HiROM/LoROM detection a bit - Fievel goes West works now

        [Matthew Kendora]
      - Fixed key combination release [Maxim]
      - Fixed source code warnings/added necessary includes [Maxim]
      - Added high priority mode for Windows 2000 users and slower
        computers (works on Windows 9x as well) [pagefault]
      - Added large sound buffer option for people having DirectSound
        problems. [pagefault]
      - Fixed problem with ZSNESW and Opera causing a BSOD. [pagefault]

      - Fixed FF3 flashing line problem [zsKnight]
      - Fixed mysterious sprite disappearing bug in the new graphics engine
        [zsKnight]
      - Reduced noise in ToP opening theme.  It works fine in the DOS port,
        but the windows port still seems to produce some static, probably
        because of the way how sound is updated in that port. [zsKnight]
      - Updated Super 2xSaI and Super Eagle code (should be much faster
        now on MMX processors) [Kreed, added by pagefault]
      - Added gzip support [teuf]
      - Added support for ViBRA16 cards [Peter Santing]
      - No longer requires zlib.dll file, now statically linked. ZSNESw won't
        crash anymore if you try to load a .zip file without that dll file.
        [pagefault]
      - Now compiled using an optimising compiler [pagefault]
      - Almost a fully re-written DSP-1 emulation engine!
        [zsKnight, theoddone33, pagefault, teuf].  Also thanks to CrASH_Man
        for the 3x3 inverse matrix formula.
      - Fixed memory leak problem in the windows port during exit [pagefault]
      - And more ...


v1.17, Win v0.85
      - Added slow-down key.  You can configure it in Misc -> Game Keys
      - Invulnerability bug of the 3rd boss in Demon's Crest in the
        good checksum roms is fixed through rom mirroring
        I also noticed that this fix is the same as what the author of
        SNEeSe told me before about on some MegamanX1 roms, but I never had
        that rom so I never added this until now.  Guess that rom
        is also fixed too.
      - Changed memory initialization values - Lost Viking 2 works again
      - 65816: Fixed WAI instruction timing with HIRQ's
        Top Gear 2 - 2 player mode works now
      - Improved IRQ re-execution timing precision
      - Starfox 2 beta now runs with sound!
      - Fixed flickering problem in Starfox 2 beta
      - Added Mode 2 16x16 tile offset per tile mode
      - (Win32) Improved the timestamps on UDP headers.  This should
        (hopefully) solve those out of sync (where both sides see different
        things) problems with certain connections (ie. T1/LAN connections) in
        netplay.
      - (Win32) Added a big notice in netplay.txt.  For all of you who used
        netplay and had poor experiences with a ping time of less than
        300ms, read it!  Also added a more realistic system requirements
        description for decent netplay in netplay.txt rather than a cpu
        speed estimate.
      - Changed reverse stereo method to become invisible to the sound
        registers in emulation

v1.14, Win v0.80
      - Fixed configuration files from removing spaces from directory names
      - (DOS) Fixed 640x480 vesa2 scanline+interpolation display problem
      - (Win32) Improved Windows speed in 32-bit windowed mode.  Should
        give around an 18% speed increase in FPS.
      - (Win32) More netplay improvements.  Shouldn't be as jumpy when
        one side lacks input.
      - (Win32) Starting netplay will now force the max frameskip to 3
        if it is less than it and also force on auto frameskip.
      - (Win32) MMX optimised netplay with back buffer enabled.
      - (Win32) Fixed load state in netplay to load properly instead
        of sometimes stalling for no reason
      - (DOS) Accidently deleted the code to initialize IPX.  Fixed now.
      - Fixed a configuration loading problem when loading ZSNES from
        a different directory.
      - (Win32) Attempted to fix those out of sync problems (although
        I don't know if it's fixed now since those problems rarely happen
        to me)
      - (Win32) Displayed the current filename in the load window
        for those files with extra long names.
      - (Win32) Added nickname support to NetPlay.  There's a 9 character
        nickname size limit.
      - (Win32) Added actions to chat (similar to how mIRC works - use
        /me <action> )
      - (Win32) Nicknames can be changed in the windowed chat by typing
        /nick <new nickname>
      - Added a small buffer to the in-game chat to allow up to 5 chat
        strings displayed at once.
      - Local chat strings now appear in that buffer
      - Thickened black borders on the 5x5 font
      - Extended in-game chat length by around 30 characters
      - Fixed up Interpolation

v1.12, Win v0.74
      - (Win32) Hopefully fixed up those green display bugs in
        scanlines/2xSaI in 1:5:5:5 16bit modes.
      - (Win32) Improved lost packet recovery time and reduced the
        number of lost packet stalls in UDP netplay (should produce
        more fluid netplay)
      - (Win32) Fixed up crashing bug in Tales of Phantasia with a 512
        byte header
      - Extended filename length of the Quick Menu
      - (Win32) Hopefully fixed up the mouse wheel support for certain
        mice
      - Temp .ZIP directory is now cleared if it exists prior to another
        .ZIP file being loaded.
      - (Win32) Improved DirectInput error handling

v1.11, Win v0.72
      - (Win32) ZSNESw won't crash anymore if you don't have a soundcard
        or if DirectSound fails to initialize.
      - (Win32) Fixed a nasty performance bug with certain types of
        joystick/drivers installed, causing the FPS to be slower for
        no reason.
      - (Win32) Wrote an MMX optimised blitter for 16bit non-D windowed
        and full screen modes.
      - (Win32) Added simple wheel mouse support.

v1.10, Win v0.70
      - Fixed games that turns on the x239 resolution (eg. Chrono Trigger
        battles) when scanline mode is enabled
      - (Win32) Fixed up crashing bugs on extra long filenames with
        underscores
      - (Win32) Hopefully fixed the odd colored interpolation in 1:5:5:5 16bit
        color settings
      - (Win32) Hopefully won't crash anymore when the temporary directory
        exists prior to unzipping a .zip file
      - (Win32) Fixed loading of .zip files with more than 2 '.'s in the
        filename.  Thanks to DCX for helping us troubleshoot this.
      - (Win32) Fixed up short filename saveram/save states loading when
        the long filename has spaces in it.
      - Added TCP/IP Support.  It is recommended that for playable netplay,
        you'd have an average ping time of less than 300ms (type
        ping <ip address> in dos) and that packet loss is minimal for TCP/IP
        (not UDP).  At the moment, you cannot have more than 2 connections
        Thanks for all the testers for testing this, especially DooMStalK,
        GreenImp, and TeleKawaru!  Also added back buffer support.  This
        will sacrifice cpu power for netplay to make it much more playable.
        WARNING: High cpu speed recommendations (~450mhz+).
                 Please see netplay.txt for details.
      - Added save states to netplay (just use them like you normally do)
      - Save Ram is now defaulted to load/save on the server's side
        Save Ram are not supported in SA-1/SuperFX games due to their size,
        but you can use save states instead in that case.
      - Increased chat line length in the out-of-game chatbox by a lot
      - Partly increased the chat line length in-game
      - in-game chat text now stays longer on-screen by 2 seconds
      - Added reset in netplay
      - Fixed up movie recording feature
      - (Win32) Mouse shouldn't get stuck on the left side anymore.
      - (Win32) Video mode 3 (256x224FS) shouldn't crash anymore.  Thanks
        to kode54 for his assistance on the above 2 bugfixes.
      - (Win32) Fixed the instability bug where the window can sometimes
        start shaking for no reason and takes away windows resources.
      - (Win32) Re-wrote keyboard character input routines
      - Fixed up FF2(4)'s music in lower sampling rates
      - (Win32) Coded in the UDP protocol as a replacement for TCP/IP.
        Some network configurations won't work with UDP.  However, it is
        strongly recommended that you use UDP if you can because of the
        speed increase.  In order to disable UDP and use TCP/IP, both sides
        must de-select UDP.  
      - (Win32) Added a small multiplayer game list (multi.txt)
      - Added an updated Windows FAQ, courtesy of TuxedoMsk of VGNetwork
        who updated it.
      - Added a more user friendly input selection routine (changed Direct
        Input to Keyb/Joystick and it also auto-sets keyb/Joystick when you
        set a key)
      - Hopefully fixed up the sprite priority problems (eg. FF2/4's
        damage points)
      - (Win32) Added rewind support for up to 8 levels (in 8 second
        intervals) (NOTE: Windows Port only! - Sorry DOS Port users).  In
        order to activate this, assign a key to the Rewind Key in the
        Misc -> GameKeys option.
      Note: Netplay plays really nice as long as the net connection is not
            unstable, both sides have a fast cpu  (speed requirements depend
            on the game), and at least have a 28.8 connection.

          THE WINDOWS PORT
