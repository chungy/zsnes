Some Issues :

SDL Port:
- Low performance due to differences in surface sizes (internal and 
  SDL), make both the same size.

Windows Port:
- OpenGL, or Direct3D support would be nice (we have the source for 
  OpenGL but it needs to be integrated into the main tree, any takers?)
- MingGW support is now added thanks to Nach! But for some reason 
  winlink.cpp will not compile with optimisations.
- Auto-detect high/low latency connections and adjust settings accordingly

Compatibility
- Game not working - Guikuden 1 (and some more)
- Graphics Glitches - Uniracers (2p mode), Killer Instinct (couple stages,
    black background), FF3 (some sprite clipping probs), Metal Combat,
    Tactic Ogre (Menus?)
- Special Chips - DSP1 (95% done), DSP2 (0% done), SA-1 (95% done),
                  SDD-1 (decompression left), and others                       

Timing engine
- Convert counter to 32-bit. (assigned to pagefault).
- Fix 65816 timing and take into consideration cycle differences in 
  8/16-bit mode, branches etc.

Graphics Engine
- Fix some windowing/subscreen sprite problems that are still present in 
  the new graphics engine. Probably pagefault will have to do this.
