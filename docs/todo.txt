Some Issues :

All Ports:
- Recode netplay feature, once core is not random anymore.

SDL Port:
- Low performance due to differences in surface sizes (internal and
  SDL), make both the same size.
- OpenGL code is awful, uncomprehensible, stupid and awful again.
  We must fix it.

Windows Port:
- OpenGL, or Direct3D support would be nice (we have the source for
  OpenGL but it needs to be integrated into the main tree, any takers?)
- MingGW support is now added thanks to Nach! But for some reason
  winlink.cpp will not compile with optimisations.

Compatibility
- Game not working - Guikuden 1, Cu-On-Pa (and loads more)
- Graphics Glitches - Killer Instinct (black background), FF3 (Range Time Over
      and other sprite trouble), Metal Combat (?), Tactic Ogre (Menus), Energy
      Breaker (mode7 world map), Super Aleste (offset incorrect in stage 4),
      lots of others...
- Special Chips - DSP1 (95% done), DSP2 (0% done), DSP3 (0% done?), DSP4 (done?)
      SA-1 (95% done), C4 (done?), SDD-1 (done?), SPC7110 (all but decomp?)
      SFX1/2 (done?), OBC1 (have to clean the mess)

Timing engine
- Convert counter to 32-bit. (assigned to pagefault).
- Fix 65816 timing and take into consideration cycle differences in
  8/16-bit mode, branches etc.

Graphics Engine
- Fix some windowing/subscreen sprite problems that are still present in
  the new graphics engine. Probably pagefault will have to do this.
