       ZSNES is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written entirely in assembly and C. Using cutting edge SNES emulation, ZSNES is easily comparable to other leading SNES emulators, such as <a href="http://www.snes9x.com">Snes9x</a>, <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/sneese/" >SNEeSe</a>, and <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/trauma/spx/">Super Sleuth</a>.<br />
       <br />
       Special thanks to the Snes9x team for all of their help and also for the excellent SNES emulator they have developed.  We wish them the very best of luck!<br />

Many more games work :D. [pagefault, _Demo_, Nach, TRAC, Overload, theoddone33]</li>
       <li>- Overhauled a lot of code, such as checksum calculation and mirroring code. Overhauled and added much better EHi/Hi/Lo ROM code, improved reset vector, changed much hard coding to variables. Fixed more SRAM bugs than can be counted. Made optimizations to complex loading functions, syntax, memory init (Thanks kode54), execution, and initialization code. Also greatly improved PAL/NTSC detection. Also now has much better chip detection and gives more informative chip names. More games which never loaded before now load properly, such as Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2 now loads and plays great without the Dejap patch. [Nach]</li>
	    
	    <li>- Cleaned up, overhauled, removed, and ported a lot of code (asm to C). [pagefault, MKendora, Nach]</li>
	    <li>- Overhauled IO latch behavior, added proper latching behavior and other latch fixes (such as proper latching of bit 7 on $4201), and added proper behavior of RDIO regs. [pagefault]</li>
	    <li>- Removed many, many hacks. [Nach, pagefault]</li>
	    <li>- There have been some modifications and reorganizations of the GUI, including new path setup and chip configuration windows and a reorganization of the Game Key window. [pagefault, Nach]</li>

	    <li>- New extra options are now available in various locations, like the "GUI burning effect", new commandline options, a new quick key to control players 1/2 with 3/4, and smaller message text. Some obsolete ones have been removed. [pagefault]</li>
	    <li>- Some changes in the Input configuaration: Hitting "Set Keys" is now prevented if controller is set to "None". Also, if no controller is selected, the settings of the individual keys are now locked. [Nach]</li>
	    <li>- Updated default configuration, in general. For example, stereo sound is now enabled by default at 32khz, with gaussian interpolation. [pagefault]</li>
	    <li>- Signed saturation fix for gaussian interpolation (Thanks kode54). [pagefault]</li>
            <li>- Fixed several Netplay issues. [_Demo_, pagefault, Nach]</li>

       <ul class="indent_list">
        <li>- You can use both keyboard and joystick for player 1 or 2 with some configuration adjustments.  Refer to the <a href="faq.htm">FAQ</a> for details.</li>
        <li>- Several special chip emulation routines (SA-1) have unknown bugs to them.</li>
        <li>- SuperFX can be slow because it is an extra 10/20mhz CPU that has to be emulated as well as the SNES emulation.</li>
        <li>- Screen Snapshot, Snapshot Format, and FPS counter are available through a menu by pressing F1 during emulation.</li>
        <li>- Screen Snapshot can save in bitmap format (65536 colors) or PNG format (32-bit ARGB color).</li>
        <li>- FPS counter currently only works when auto frame rate is on.</li>
        <li>- To use the cheat function, be sure to have the ROM which you want to patch loaded already.</li>
        <li>- If the cheat codes do not work, chances are that you are either using a different version of the ROM that was originally used to create them or the codes are converted incorrectly from other code formats.</li>
        <li>- There are still many bugs left in ZSNES, so don't expect it to run all your favorite games.</li>
        <li>- SNES Mouse support is still missing some features, such as speed settings.</li>
        <li>- Pressing the Fast Forward key is equivalent to running ZSNES using -f 9.</li>
        <li>- If ZSNES doesn't work for you, then don't use it.  Use Snes9x, SNEeSe, or Super Sleuth instead!  In fact, even if you use ZSNES, use those emulators too!</li>

        <li>Save SPC Data - Selecting this will search for the beginning of the next song and save the data into a .spc file, which saves it similarly as a .srm file.  To capture a song, it is best recommended to initiate this feature approximately 2 seconds before the next song starts.  This does have potential to fail though, so don't expect it to work all the time.</li>
        <li>Sound Buffer Dump - This dumps the sound buffer in ZSNES and also filters out any unoccupied space.  The sound buffer contains decompressed samples which are written to when ZSNES plays/decodes a sample from sound memory. Because of the way ZSNES buffers the sound data, this can produce inaccurate results.</li>
        <li>Snapshot/Increment Frame - Same as snapshot, but it returns to the F1 menu after a couple of frames.  Useful for making animations.</li>

       Currently, ZSNES supports Game Genie, Pro Action Replay and GoldFinger codes.<br />
       <br />
       Here are the steps to get the codes working :<br />
       <br />
       1.) Load the ROM which you want to patch.<br />
       2.) Exit to the GUI, enter the code of your choice in the cheat menu.<br />
       3.) After that, you may have to RESET the game to get the cheat code to work.  Sometimes, it is not necessary.  You also may have to click on the FIX button.<br />
       <br />
       NOTE : Some cheat codes are meant to be for different versions of the game.  If a cheat code doesn't work and there is one for both Game Genie and Pro Action Replay, try them both.<br />

       To enable SNES Mouse, press 7 once for 1st player and twice for 2nd player.<br />
       To enable SNES Super Scope, press 7 three times.<br />
       To disable either one, either press 6 or press 7 until you see a disable message onscreen.<br />
       <br />
       Here are the controls for the Super Scope :<br />
       <br />
       Fire = Left mouse button<br />
       Cursor Mode Button = Right mouse button<br />
       Pause = Backspace key on keyboard<br />
       Enable/Disable Autofire = =/+ key on keyboard<br />
       <br />
       ZSNES auto-detects the SFX emulation from the header and enables it when found.  Also, take note that the SFX is an additional 10Mhz(Ver1) or 20Mhz(Ver2) chip which also has to be emulated with the SNES; it will most likely produce a very noticeable slow down in emulation if you don't have a fast computer.<br />
       <br />
       Sometimes, the MultiTap isn't compatible with some games.  If that happens, disable MultiTap by going to Config-->Add-Ons and choosing None. You may also need to go to Config-->Options, and enable "Use Player 3/4 as Player 1/2". You could also add an <a href="http://nsrt.edgeemu.com">NSRT header</a> to your ROM.<br />
       <br />
       IPS patcher:<br />
       Rename your .IPS file to the ROM filename with the .IPS extension (eg. If your ROM is SD3.SMC and your ips is SD3V05.IPS, rename SD3V05.IPS to SD3.IPS) and ZSNES will patch the ROM in realtime without modifying the ROM file's contents. Zipped ROMs are patched according to the unzipped name (eg. Seiken3.zip containing SD3.smc is patched by SD3.ips, not Seiken3.ips). You can also use .IPS files that are inside .ZIP files.<br />

      <td class='TBoxText'>
       - 65816 lacks correct timing.  Although ZSNES bases the timing on a variable cycle/instruction, it does not deduct correct values (such as 16bit instructions should deduct 1 more cycle than 8bit instructions). 100% cycles of ZSNES isn't 100% cycles of a SNES because of that. This means that a lot of games either won't run or will produce horrible displays.  Sometimes, adjusting the % of execution can fix those problems. This is all due to inaccurate documentation used when the ZSNES 65816 core was written. There are no plans on re-writing the 65816 timing yet.<br />
       - Games sometimes tend to not display things properly because of graphic features that aren't implemented yet.<br />
       - The Sound DSP chip still has its bugs (not many though). Most noticeably, no one knows the exact timing of the SPC700 chip.<br />
