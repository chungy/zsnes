  <h1>GUI</h1>

  <div class="content_body">
     <img src="images/gui.png" alt="This is the ZSNES GUI." /><br />
    Note: If any window exists in the GUI field, pressing ESC always closes the top-most window.<br />
    Note: Pressing ESC when no window is active is equivalent to RUN.  It will not function if no game is loaded.<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li><span class="list_head">Notes on the filename box where you can manually type in the filename:</span></li>
      <li>- Typing text into the box will automatically seek to the closest matching filename in the box where the file selection cursor is located.</li>
      <li>- When you press enter with text in the box without any '\' or ':' in the filename, ZSNES will first look for a directory matching the text and will then change its directory if one is found.  Otherwise, it will load the current file or directory highlighted by the selection cursor.</li>
      <li>- You can type in the full filename or directory including path (eg. "d:\games\mario.smc" or just "d:").<br /></li>

              <li>Auto Frame Rate - Enables auto frame rate.</li>
	          <li>Max Frame Skip - Shown only when auto frame rate is enabled, this sets the maximum allowable frame skip in auto frame rate mode.</li>
	          <li>Frame Rate - Sets the constant frame skip value used when a game plays. This is only shown when auto frame rate is disabled.</li>
              <li>New Gfx Engine - Enables/Disables the new graphics engine in 256 color modes or 320x240x65536 mode.</li>
              <li>MMX Support - Enables MMX copying routines for a slight speed increase (MMX processors only).</li>
              <li>Use Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 - Allows the user to use 2 devices for 1 player, such as the keyboard and the joystick. (set keyboard as input device 1 and joystick as input device 3).  This, however, disables MultiTap support.</li>
              <li>Sidewinder Fix - If your Sidewinder doesn't work after disabling the Sidewinder profiler and having pressed the mode button twice, enable this.
              <li>FPS at Program Start - Checking this will make the FPS appear whenever you start ZSNES.</li>
              <li>Use 30Hz for Turbo - When activated, turbo will change at 30hz NTSC or 25hz PAL.  Otherwise, turbo will change at 60hz NTSC or 50hz PAL.</li>
              <li>Enable Game Clock - Enabling this will show the system clock on-screen.</li>
              <li>Toggled Fast Fwd/Slowdown - Checking this will change the way how the fast forward button functions.  Having it checked will cause it to act as a switch and having it unchecked will cause it to act as a push button.</li>
              <li>Old Gfx Mode 2 - This will enable the Old Gfx Engine Mode 2, which fixes many transparency bugs that currently plagues ZSNES in the current engine. However, it also creates some new ones.  This mode can be slower at times, so it's recommended that you only turn it on when you need it.</li>
              <li>Don't Save Current Path - This will prevent ZSNES from changing the current start-up game path in the configuration.</li>
              <li>Use Small Message Text - On-screen messages that pop up when you save a state, disable a background, ect. will be smaller.</li>
              <li>Enable Auto-Patch - When checked, ZSNES will automatically soft patch ROMs when a corresponding .ips file is found.</li>
              <li>Enable ROMINFO.TXT - When checked, ZSNES will create a file named ROMINFO.TXT when you load a ROM. This file contains information about the ROM.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br />
      </li>
      <li>Video:
        <ul>
          <li>Perform: Changes the current video mode and sets some options.</li>
          <li>Usage:
            <ul>
              <li>Changing the video mode - Use the mouse to select the video mode and click 'SET'. If the resulting video changes don't look right, wait for 10 seconds without pressing any key or button and the display will return to the previous one.</li>
              <li>Scanlines - Only available in 256x256x256 and VESA2 640x480 modes. This mode adds a blank line in between every line to produce a scanline effect similar, if not exact, to a TV.</li>
              <li>50% Scanlines - Only available in 640x480x16B video mode. This will enable scanline mode except that each line is 50% darker than the line above it.</li>
              <li>25% Scanlines - Only available in 640x480x16B video mode. This will enable scanline mode except that each line is 25% darker than the line above it.</li>
              <li>2xSaI Engine - Setting this will enable Kreed's 2x Scale Advanced Interpolation engine.</li>
              <li>Eagle Engine - Only available in VESA2 320x240x256. Setting this would enable the Eagle Engine designed by Dirk Stevens, which basically locates 3 similar colored pixels together and places a small dot in between to smooth out some graphics.</li>
              <li>Super Eagle - Setting this will enable Kreed's Super Eagle engine.</li>
              <li>Super 2xSaI Engine - Setting this will enable Kreed's Super 2x Scale Advanced Interpolation engine.</li>
              <li>Interpolation - Setting this enables interpolation, which basically blends all the inbetween colors to produce a blurry effect. However, this slows down emulation.</li>
              <li>Hi-resolution Mode 7 - Enabling this will activate high resolution mode 7 whenever standard mode 7 is used within a game.  This mode is only available in video modes that support it.</li>
              <li>Grayscale Mode - Makes the game display in monochrome color, i.e. black and white. This option is just there for fun and is not something that you probably want to keep on using.</li>
              <li>Triple Buffering - This will enable triple buffering if it is available on your VESA drivers/Video Card. If it isn't available, then ZSNES will use simulated triple buffering, which is slower, but still does the job. Uses an extra buffer for drawing. Thus, a buffer can be drawn on while one is pending Vsync, and another is being drawn. The primary use is to reduce the impact of Vsync on slower systems. Note that triple buffering will not work with 2xSaI/Super Eagle.</li>
              <li>Vsync - Synchronizes drawing to the monitor's refresh rate. This may reduce frame rate on your computer, but will reduce tearing.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br />
      </li>
      <li>Sound:
        <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows user to change the sound configurations of ZSNES.</li>
          <li>Usage:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable Sound - Setting this turns on the sound.</li>
              <li>Force 8-bit - Force ZSNES to output sound in 8-bit mode. May work around problems with certain soundcards, but will reduce sound quality.</li>
              <li>Stereo Sound - Enables stereo sound (slower unless you have a fast CPU).</li>
              <li>Raise Pitch Level - Enabling this will cause the pitch of the sound to be raised.</li>
              <li>Sampling Rate - To change the sound sampling rate, just click on the box containing the value to rotate through all the possible values. The default sampling rate (and the one that is most accurate to a real SNES) is 32000hz.</li>
              <li>Volume Level - To change, just slide the bar.</li>
              <li>Reverse Stereo - This function swaps the L and R volume levels in stereo mode.</li>
              <li>Surround Sound - Enables simulated 2 speaker surround sound.</li><li>Sound Buffering - Enable to provide a larger sound buffer for sound cards that have problems with the sound.</li>
              <li>Sound Buffering - Enabling this may reduce/prevent sound crackling on some computers.</li>
              <li>Disable SPC Emulation - Disables the emulation of the SPC700 chip. Doing this will speed up emulation, but the downside is that it tends to bring more sound errors.</li>
              <li>Sound Interpolation - This feature smoothes out the wave forms of lower frequency sounds. Choose either gaussian (default and the most accurate to a real SNES) or cubic spline.</li>
              <li>Low Pass Filter - This produces better bass in certain sound effects.  However, the side effect is that the sound will overall be more muffled. Choose either simple or dynamic.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br />
      </li>
      <li>Paths:
        <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows user to change the default directories used by ZSNES.</li>
	      <li>Usage:
	        <ul>
	          <li>Saves - Configure the directory in which ZSNES will place SRAM and state save files.</li>
	          <li>Snapshots - Configure which directory bitmap (.bmp; 16bit color) and PNG (.png; 32bit ARGB color) format snapshots will save in.</li>
	          <li>SPCs - Configure which directory SPC700 sound dumps (.spc; SNES music files) will save in.</li>
	          <li>BIOS/Base Carts - Enter the location of BIOS/Base carts here, to support emulation of the BS Satellaview, Sufami Turbo, and the Same Game and SD Gundam G-Next expansion packs.</li>
	          <li>SPC7110 Graphic Packs - Enter the directories that contain SPC7110 graphic packs in the appropriate fields here. The SPC7110 games are Far East of Eden Zero (FEOEZ), Far East of Eden Zero - Shounen Jump no Shou (FEOEZ-SJNS), Momotarou Dentetsu Happy (MDH), and Super Power League 4 (SPL4).</li>
              <li>Note: Paths can be absolute (C:\Path\To\File\) or relative (..\Path\Relative\To\ZSNES\).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Saves:
        <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows user to configure options regarding state saves and in-game saves.</li>
          <li>Usage:
            <ul>
              <li>Auto Increment Save Slot - When enabled, the save slot will automatically move to the next slot after you save a state.</li>
              <li>SRAM Check+Save - This will enable automatic save RAM write detection and save the SRAM (.srm) to disk approximately 10 seconds after.</li>
              <li>Start at Latest Save - Checking this will automatically set the save state pointer (F3 Menu) to the most recently saved location whenever you load a ROM image.</li>
              <li>Auto State Save/Load - Enabling this will allow ZSNES to automatically re-load the state whenever you return back to the game after a proper exit.</li>
            </ul>

      <li>Cheat Code Reflector - What this feature does is that it allows a value of one cheat code to be mirrored from a value of another cheat code.  To enable this option, type an 'R' at the end of any cheat code as the destination, then type another cheat code (Without the 'R') as the source. For example, if you want address 7E1000 to reflect the value at address 7F2000 (whatever value written to 7E2000 from the game will also be written to 7E1000), enter cheat code 7E1000FFR, then cheat code 7F2000FF (where FF can be any value).<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Browse:
          <ul>
            <li>Perform: Enters the cheat code window and sets the keyboard cursor at the browse box.</li>
            <li>Usage: Move through the list using either the mouse or keyboard and select the cheat code you want to modify.  Then click on the buttons to the right or type in the key of the first letter of the action.
              <ul>
                <li>Actions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Toggle - Turns a cheat code on or off.</li>
                  <li>Remove - Deletes the cheat code off the list.</li>
                  <li>Save - Saves the current list into a .cht file, which will be located in the save directory.</li>
                  <li>Load - Loads a previously saved list.</li>
                  <li>Fix - Clicking this fixes some cheat codes that don't work, but it will not always work.</li>
                  <li>You can also toggle a cheat code on or off by double clicking on them.</li>
                </ul>

      <li>Search:
        <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows you to search for values in memory such as life, score, etc. and allows you to change their values to your own preferred choice.</li>
          <li>Usage:
            <ul>
              <li>Select Size: You can choose what data size to search for.  If you know the numerical values of the data you're going to select, select the smallest number range that fits the data values. (eg.  If you know the value cannot go higher than 50000, then select 2 BYTES (0..65535) instead of 3 BYTES (0..16777215)). Sometimes, you don't know the numerical value (in the case of life bars) so you have to guess the size.</li>
              <li>Select Format: DEC (Decimal, 0 .. 9), HEX (Hexadecimal, 0 .. F) Most of the time, it's recommended that you'd use decimal, although there are some cases that the values in memory are sometimes stored as hex.</li>
              <li>Search Type:
                <ul>
                  <li>Exact Value Search - In this mode, you have to enter the exact numerical value that you want to search for.  Such as if you have 3 lives left, then search for the value 3.  The cheat search engine also looks for value - 1 since even if a game tells you that you have 3 lives left, it stores the value as 2 in memory.</li>
                  <li>Comparative Search - In this mode, you select whether the value is less than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to the previous value.  Such as if you have a life bar and if the life bar suddenly goes down, go back to the cheat search engine and select less than to search for any value that has been decreased.</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Movies are saved as .zmv, .zm1, .zm2, etc. files.  They should be located in the same directory as your save files.  A movie file consists of a save state file, SRAM data, and the recorded controller data.  The initial filesize of a .zmv file is the combination of a .zst and a .srm file (around 300kbytes), and it averages around 7kbytes/minute (value varies) or 420kbytes/hour.<br /><br /></li>
              <li>You can record:
                <ul>
                  <li>- Standard 1/2 player games</li>
                  <li>- 3-4 player MultiTap games</li>
                  <li>- SNES Mouse games</li>
                  <li>- Network/Modem games</li>
                </ul>

              <li>Stop   - Stops the movie process.</li>
              <li>The numbers at the right side select which movie file to play/record.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>NOTE: Movies recorded without sound cannot be played when sound is enabled and vice versa.</li>
          <li>NOTE: Loading another game, loading a state, or resetting the game will halt the play/record process.</li>
          <li>NOTE: When you play a movie file, the SRAM data becomes invalid, and ZSNES won't save it until you load a game.  This way, you don't have to worry about your SRAM when you load up a movie file.</li>
