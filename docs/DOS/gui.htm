       Note : If any window exists in the GUI field, pressing ESC always closes the top-most window.<br />
       Note : Pressing ESC when no window is active is equivalent to RUN.  It will not function if no game is loaded.<br />
       <br />
       Notes on the filename box where you can manually type in the filename:<br />
       - Typing text into the box will automatically seek to the closest matching filename in the box where the file selection cursor is located.<br />
       - When you press enter with text in the box without any '\' or ':' in the filename, ZSNES will first look for a directory matching the text and will then change its directory if one is found.  Otherwise, it will load the current file or directory highlighted by the selection cursor.<br />
       - You can type in the full filename or directory including path (eg. d:\games\mario.smc) or the drive name (eg. d:).<br />

          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>Auto Frame Rate - enables auto frame rate.</li>
			<li>Max Frame Skip - Shown only when auto frame rate is enabled, this sets the maximum allowable frame skip in auto frame rate mode.</li>
			<li>Frame Rate - Sets the constant frame skip value used when a game plays. This is only shown when auto frame rate is disabled.</li>
			<li>New Gfx Engine - Enables/Disables the new graphics engine in 256 color modes or 320x240x65536 mode.</li>
			<li>Auto Increment Save Slot - When enabled, the save slot will automatically move to the next slot after you save a state.</li>
			<li>MMX Support - Enables MMX Copying routines for a slight speed increase (MMX processors only).</li>
			<li>Use Pl3/4 as Pl1/2 - Allows the user to use 2 devices for 1 player, such as the keyboard and the joystick. (set keyboard as input device 1 and joystick as input device 3).  This, however, disables multitap support.</li>
            <li>FPS at Program Start - Checking this will make the FPS appear whenever you start ZSNES.</li>
            <li>Use 30Hz for Turbo - When activated, Turbo will change at 30hz NTSC or 25hz PAL.  Otherwise, Turbo will change at 60hz NTSC or 50hz PAL</li>
            <li>Enable Game Clock - Enabling this will show the system clock on-screen.</li>
            <li>Toggled Fast Fwd/Slowdown - Checking this will change the way how the fast forward button functions.  Having it checked will cause it to act as a switch and having it unchecked will cause it to act as a push button.</li>
            <li>SRAM Check+Save - This will enable automatic save RAM write detection and save the SRAM (.srm) to disk approximately 10 seconds after.</li>
            <li>Old Gfx Mode 2 - This will enable the Old Gfx Engine Mode 2, which fixes many transparency bugs that currently plagues ZSNES in the current engine. However, it also creates some new ones.  This mode can be slower at times so it's recommended that you only turn it on when you need it.</li>
            <li>Start at Latest Save - Checking this will automatically set the save state pointer (F3 Menu) to the most recently saved location whenever you load a ROM image.</li>
            <li>Auto State Save/Load - Enabling this will allow ZSNES to automatically re-load the state whenever you return back to the game after a proper exit.</li>
            <li>Don't Save Current Path - This will prevent ZSNES from changing the current start-up game path in the configuration.</li>
			<li>Use Small Message Text - On-screen messages that pop up when you save a state, disable a background, ect. will be smaller.</li>
            <li>Disable Screensaver - Disables the screensaver while ZSNES is running, so that your gameplay will not be interrupted if you're using a gamepad.</li>

          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>None - Uses the regular SNES controllers.</li>
            <li>SNES Mouse at Port #1 - Emulates the SNES Mouse at controller port #1.</li>
            <li>SNES Mouse at Port #2 - Emulates the SNES Mouse at controller port #2.</li>
            <li>Super Scope - Emulates the SNES Super Scope.</li>
            <li>Lethal Enforcer Gun - Simulates the SNES Mouse movements for Lethal Enforcers 1.</li>
			<li>Super System - Toggle DIP switches here to configure the Nintendo Super System.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
         </ul>
        <br />
        </li>
        <li>Video:
         <ul>
          <li>Perform: Changes the current video mode and sets some options.</li>
          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>Changing the video mode - Use the mouse to select the video mode and click 'SET'. If the resulting video changes don't look right, wait for 10 seconds without pressing any key or button and the display will return to the previous one.</li>
            <li>Full Scanlines - This mode adds a blank line in between every line to produce a scanline effect similar, if not exact, to a TV.</li>
			<li>50% Scanlines - This will enable scanline mode, except that each line is 50% darker than the line above it.</li>
			<li>25% Scanlines - This will enable scanline mode, except that each line is 25% darker than the line above it.</li>
			<li>2xSaI Engine - Setting this will enable Kreed's 2x Scale Advanced Interpolation engine.</li>
			<li>Super Eagle - Setting this will enable Kreed's Super Eagle engine.</li>
			<li>Super 2xSaI Engine - Setting this will enable Kreed's Super 2x Scale Advanced Interpolation engine.</li>
			<li>HQ2X, HQ3X, and HQ4X - Depending on what D mode resolution you are using, you will be able to choose one of these three graphic filters created by MaxSt.</li>
            <li>Interpolation - Setting this enables interpolation, which basically blends all the inbetween colors to produce a blurry effect. However, this slows down emulation.</li>
            <li>Hi-resolution Mode 7 - Enabling this will activate high resolution mode 7 whenever standard mode 7 is used within a game.  This mode is only available in video modes that support it.</li>
            <li>Grayscale Mode - Makes the game display in monochrome color. This option is just there for fun and is not something that you probably want to keep on using.</li>
            <li>Triple Buffering - Uses an extra buffer for drawing. Thus, a buffer can be drawn on while one is pending Vsync, and another is being drawn. The primary use is to reduce the impact of Vsync on slower systems.</li>
	        <li>Vsync - Synchronizes drawing to the monitor's refresh rate. This may reduce frame rate on your computer, but will reduce tearing.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
         </ul>
        <br />
        </li>
        <li>Sound:
         <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows user to change the sound configurations of ZSNES.</li>
          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>Enable Sound - Setting this turns on the sound.</li>
            <li>Stereo Sound - Enables stereo sound (noticeably slower though unless you have a fast CPU).</li>
            <li>Sampling Rate - To change the sound sampling rate, just click on the box containing the value to rotate through all the possible values. The default sampling rate (and the one that is most accurate to a real SNES) is 32000hz.</li>
            <li>Volume Level - To change, just slide the bar.</li>
            <li>Reverse Stereo - This function swaps the L and R volume levels in stereo mode.</li>
            <li>Surround Sound - Enables simulated 2 speaker surround sound.</li><li>Sound Buffering - Enable to provide a larger sound buffer for sound cards that have problems with the sound.</li><li>Disable SPC Emulation - Disables the emulation of the SPC700 chip. Doing this will speed up emulation, but the downside is that it tends to bring more sound errors.</li>
            <li>Sound Interpolation - This feature smoothes out the wave forms of lower frequency sounds. Choose either gaussian (default and the most accurate to a real SNES), cubic spline, or 8-point interpolation.</li>
            <li>Low Pass Filter - This produces better bass in certain sound effects.  However, the side effect is that the sound will overall be more muffled. Choose either simple, dynamic, or hi quality.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <br />
        </li>
        <li>Paths:
         <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows user to change the default directories used by ZSNES.</li>
	      <li>Usage:
	       <ul>
	        <li>Snapshots - Configure which directory bitmap (.bmp; 16bit color) and PNG (.png; 32bit ARGB color) format snapshots will save in.</li>
	        <li>SPCs - Configure which directory SPC700 sound dumps (.spc; SNES music files) will save in.</li>
	        <li>BIOS/Base Carts - Enter the location of BIOS/Base carts here, to support emulation of the BS Satellaview, Sufami Turbo, and the Same Game and SD Gundam G-Next expansion packs.</li>
	        <li>SPC7110 Graphic Packs - Enter the directories that contain SPC7110 graphic packs in the appropriate fields here. The SPC7110 games are Far East of Eden Zero (FEOEZ), Far East of Eden Zero - Shounen Jump no Shou (FEOEZ-SJNS), Momotarou Dentetsu Happy (MDH), and Super Power League 4 (SPL4).</li>

For example, if you want address 7E1000 to reflect the value at address 7F2000 (whatever value written to 7E2000 from the game will also be written to 7E1000), enter cheat code 7E1000FFR, then cheat code 7F2000FF (where FF can be any value).<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Browse:
         <ul>
          <li>Perform: Enters the cheat code window and sets the keyboard cursor at the browse box.</li>
          <li>Usage: Move through the list using either the mouse or keyboard and select the cheat code you want to modify.  Then click on the buttons to the right or type in the key of the first letter of the action.
           <ul>
            <li>Actions:
             <ul>
              <li>Toggle - Turns a cheat code on or off.</li>
              <li>Remove - Deletes the cheat code off the list.</li>
              <li>Save - Saves the current list into a .cht file, which will be located in the save directory.</li>
              <li>Load - Loads a previously saved list.</li>
              <li>Fix - Clicking this fixes some cheat codes that don't work, but it will not always work.</li>
              <li>You can also toggle a cheat code on or off by double clicking on them.</li>

        <li>Search:
         <ul>
          <li>Perform: Allows you to search for values in memory such as life, score, etc. and allows you to change their values to your own preferred choice.</li>
          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>Select Size: You can choose what data size to search for.  If you know the numerical values of the data you're going to select, select the smallest number range that fits the data values. (eg.  If you know the value cannot go higher than 50000, then select 2 BYTES (0..65535) instead of 3 BYTES (0..16777215)). Sometimes, you don't know the numerical value (in the case of life bars) so you have to guess the size.</li>
            <li>Select Format: DEC (Decimal, 0 .. 9), HEX (Hexadecimal, 0 .. F) Most of the time, it's recommended that you'd use decimal, although there are some cases that the values in memory are sometimes stored as hex.</li>
            <li>Search Type:
             <ul>
              <li>Exact Value Search - In this mode, you have to enter the exact numerical value that you want to search for.  Such as if you have 3 lives left, then search for the value 3.  The cheat search engine also looks for value - 1 since even if a game tells you that you have 3 lives left, it stores the value as 2 in memory.</li>
              <li>Comparative Search - In this mode, you select whether the value is less than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to the previous value.  Such as if you have a life bar and if the life bar suddenly goes down, go back to the cheat search engine and select less than to search for any value that has been decreased.</li>

        <li>Modem Mode:
         <ul>
          <li>Note #1:  DOS Compatible modem is REQUIRED! If you don't know your modem settings and you're in win95/98, go to Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager -> Modem and select your modem.  Then click on your resources tab and the settings should be there.
           <ul>
            <li>1.) Dial Menu - Allows you to enter the phone number to dial and then dials and connects</li>
            <li>2.) Wait for Ring - Waits for ring</li>
            <li>3.) Config Modem  - Allows you to configure your modem:
             <ul>
              <li>ComPort, IRQ, Baudrate - Sets your modem settings</li>
              <li>Use Fossil Driver - Set this option if you want ZSNES to use your a fossil driver.  If you don't know what a fossil driver is, just leave this option unchecked and pretend it doesn't exist.</li>
             </ul>
            </li>
            <li>4.) Manual - Allows you to connect manually through the terminal.  However, if both remote and local users select manual, the player numbers will not be assigned.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>IPX: IPX mode currently connects at the first remote connection it detects. This will probabily change in the future if there is a demand.</li>
          <li>Chat Mode:
           <ul>
            <li>Latency - The lower the number, the better the control response time.  But setting it too low can cause a lot of frame skip problems. This value should vary depending on the traffic of the connection you are using.  A value of 2 or 3 is recommended for modem.  The value for IPX varies.  Latency is basically the amount of time between a user input and that input being affected in the actual game.  The delay should be higher than the time it takes for data to move from one end to the other. Latency value of 1 is equivalent to 1/30th of a second on NTSC games or 1/25th of a second on PAL games.</li>
            <li>Player # boxes - This will allow you to select up to a 5 player multiplayer game.  Anything that is checked will be controlled locally starting from player 1 as the lowest checked player.  Anything marked with an X will be controlled remotely. For example, if players 2,3,5 are checked and 1,4 are X'ed:
             <ul>
              <li>local player 1 will control player 2</li>
              <li>local player 2 will control player 3</li>
              <li>local player 3 will control player 5</li>
              <li>remote player 1 will control player 1</li>
              <li>remote player 2 will control player 4</li>

          <li>Usage:
           <ul>
            <li>Movies are saved as .ZMV, .ZM1, .ZM2, etc. files.  They should be located in the same directory as your save files.  A movie file consists of a save state file, SRAM data, and the recorded controller data.  The initial filesize of a .ZMV file is the combination of a .zst and a .srm file (around 300kbytes), and it averages around 7kbytes/minute (value varies) or 420kbytes/hour.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>You can record:
             <ul>
              <li>- Standard 1/2 player games</li>
              <li>- 3-4 player Multitap games</li>
              <li>- SNES Mouse games</li>

            <li>Play   - Begins playing the movie file.</li>
            <li>Stop   - Stops the movie process.</li>
            <li>The numbers at the right side select which movie file to play/record.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>NOTE: Movies recorded without sound cannot be played when sound is enabled and vice versa.</li>
          <li>NOTE: Loading another game, loading a state, or resetting the game will halt the play/record process.</li>
          <li>NOTE: When you play a movie file, the SRAM data becomes invalid, and ZSNES won't save it until you load a game.  This way, you don't have to worry about your SRAM when you load up a movie file.</li>
