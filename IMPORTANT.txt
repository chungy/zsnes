Important behaviour change from b14 to b15 (and after) :

WinCvs now relies on the login given by the system
(which is the login you use at start-up) when making
a .rhosts authentication.

This behaviour is the original one cvs uses, but I did supply a hack
so LOGNAME was interpreted first, which is STUPID (it is
a security hole) !

Thanks to Neal Becker who reported this bug. So check your
login name if you use the .rhosts authentication !

Also the "Force using the CVSROOT" is grayed-out because it is buggy right now
in cvs 1.10. This is a known issue and I hope it will be fixed soon (Suggestion
of Steve Cameron).

Enjoy !
